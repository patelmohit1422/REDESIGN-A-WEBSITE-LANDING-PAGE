# REDESIGN-A-WEBSITE-LANDING-PAGE

*COMPANY*: CODETACH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: JYANI MOHIT

*INTERN ID*:CT08DN821

*DOMAIN*:UI/UX DESIGN

*DURATION*: 8 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

*As part of the UI/UX internship with CodeTech IT Solutions, Task 1 required me to redesign the homepage of an existing website to improve its structure, visual appeal, and user experience. I chose Penny Juice, a juice concentrate brand targeted primarily toward schools and childcare centers. The original website had outdated design elements, unclear structure, and lacked modern UI/UX principles. My goal was to create a clean, fresh, and fun version of the homepage that feels trustworthy and appealing, especially to parents and school decision-makers.*

*üîç Problems in the Original Website*

*The original Penny Juice website had several usability and design flaws:*

*The layout lacked proper visual hierarchy and whitespace.*

*There was no clear structure between hero, product, and footer areas.*

*Important content was hidden or difficult to locate quickly.*

*The design was not responsive or accessible.*

*There were no product highlights, benefits section, or customer testimonials ‚Äî all key trust-building elements.*
